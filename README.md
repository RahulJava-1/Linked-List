# Linked-List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
In a linked list all the node conected to the previous node. Each node have two part one is DATA field and second is LINK field which links next node. In linked list we can easily perform the insertion and deletion operation with respect to Array.

There are three type of linkedlist -> 1.Singly linked list 2. Doubly linked list 3. Circular linked list

# Singly-linked list:
A simple linked list is also known as singly linked list. All the node conected to the previous node. Each node have two part one is DATA field and second is LINK field which links next node.

# Doubly-linked-list:
A doubly linked list or two way linked list is a complex type of linked list which contains a pointer to next node as well as previous node in sequence. Therefore, it contains three parts are Data, a pointer to next node, and a pointer to previous node.

# Circular-linked-list
A circular linked list is that in which the last node contains the pointer to the first node.
